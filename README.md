# Uber-NDPO-Privacy-by-Design-Assessment
This repository contains the comprehensive assessment and evaluation of Uber's mobile application using Qatar's National Data Privacy Office (NDPO) Privacy by Design (PbD) assessment tool. The assessment aimed to evaluate Uber's mobile application in accordance with the standards established by Qatar's National Data Privacy Office (NDPO) under the Personal Data Privacy Protection Law (PDPPL) and the PbD principles. Developed for the Privacy in the Digital Era course at the University of Doha for Science and Technology (UDST), this project aims to provide hands-on experience in applying and evaluating PbD principles, conducting privacy evaluations, and generating tailored privacy recommendations.

## Repository Structure

## Assessment Tool Overview
The NDPO Privacy by Design assessment tool is an Excel-based tool designed to help evaluate privacy practices across different applications. It includes the following key components:

### Sheet 1: Read This First: This sheet provides an introduction to the tool, including its purpose, scope, and references. It highlights the need for conducting Privacy by Design assessments and offers guidance on how to use the tool effectively.

### Sheet 2: Initial Information Request: This sheet gathers preliminary information about the application under assessment. For this project, the initial information regarding Uber's mobile application is documented here.

### Sheet 3: Assessment: This sheet is where the actual assessment is conducted. It evaluates 45 privacy controls across 7 Privacy by Design domains. Each control is categorized as effective, partially effective, ineffective, or not applicable and includes:
• Domain: The specific area of privacy being evaluated.
• Control ID: A unique identifier for each control.
• Control Title: The title of the control.
• Control Description: A detailed description of what the control entails.
• Privacy by Design Principle: The PbD principle that the control is based on.
• Control Effectiveness: An evaluation of how effective the control is.
• Observation: Notes and observations made during the assessment.

## Summary of Key Findings and Recommendations
• Strengths: Robust access controls, comprehensive data encryption, and regular privacy notices.
• Concerns: Inconsistent anonymization, data retention policy gaps, third-party data sharing, and audit logging deficiencies.
• Recommendations: Develop anonymization techniques, enforce data retention policies, strengthen third-party data sharing controls, and maintain audit logs.

## Conclusion
The assessment highlights the importance of Privacy by Design principles in app development and provides actionable insights to enhance Uber's privacy practices. This project serves as a practical example of applying theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, underscoring the significance of privacy in the digital era.
